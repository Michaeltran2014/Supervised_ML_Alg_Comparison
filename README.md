# Supervised_ML_Alg_Comparison
Compares the accuracy of three supervised machine learning algorithms 

# Synopsis
---
This project is designed to compare three different supervised machine learning algorithms (Adaboost, Decision Tree, Random Forest), based on their accuracies.

Three data sets have been selected from their UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (credit for data sets go to their respective owners).
Analysis will be done on these three data sets (includes cleaning of the data for our purposes).
